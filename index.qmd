## Overview of the Bioinformatics Training Programme

The Genomics Aotearoa Bioinformatics Training Programme aims to upskill the research community of Aotearoa in the rapidly growing field of bioinformatics.

Training is offered through a portfolio of free, interactive workshops instructed by experts. Workshop material covers basic coding for beginners to highly advanced, specialised workflows. 

We work closely with our partners at NeSI (New Zealand eScience Infrastructure), who have custom built a digital training platform to host workshops. When you join a training session, either in person or over zoom, you will access a digital environment with everything you need. No installations, no software requirements, all you need is an internet connection. 

Since it's inception in 2019, Genomics Aotearoa's training programme has hosted 94 workshops reaching more than 1,800 participants.



## Are you the right person to attend our training?

If you are doing, or will be doing, research in Aoteroa that requires bioinformatics tools or skills, you are the right person to attend our training. We have workshops suitable for all skill levels: many of our attendees have their first interaction with any form of coding or programming lanugage during our workshops. 

Our workshops are led by knowledgeable field experts and formally trained educators, with help from enthusiastic members of the research and training community. Workshops are run under the Carpentries Code of Conduct to ensure a safe, comfortable working environment. 

Whether you are an absolute beginner who has not yet started any bioinformatics, or an experienced user looking to start quickly with a specialist method, we can help. To see our list of workshops with descriptions of each, visit our [Workshop Portfolio](portfolio.qmd) page.
