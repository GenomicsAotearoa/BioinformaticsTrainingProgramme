## Who, and what, is Genomics Aotearoa?

Genomics Aotearoa is a collaborative research platform which brings researchers together to focus on genomics and bioinformatics projects. Projects are organised under the three themes of Health, Environment, and Primary Production and are underpinned by a focus on bioinformatics and Te Ao Māori. Government-funded through the Strategic Science Investment Fund, Genomics Aotearoa aims to grow and develop our country's research capabilities while carrying out cutting edge research. Genomics Aotearoa endeavours to be an inclusive environment, and strives to put Te Ao Māori (the Māori worldview) at the core of our research and training. The training programme is a core part of GA's commitment to building capability and capacity in the fields of bioinformatics and genomics for New Zealand researchers.
