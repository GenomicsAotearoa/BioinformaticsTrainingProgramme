## Who are we?

The training team includes members of both Genomics Aotearoa and REANNZ (Research and Education Advanced Network New Zealand), as well as Postdoctoral Fellows and early career researchers who volunteer their time. 

All workshops are led by an **Instructor**: *subject matter experts who deliver high-level knowledge of the topic, demonstrating code in real-time*.

All workshops are supported by **Helpers**: *knowledgeable people who answer one-off questions or help you to solve issues as they arise*.
w
**All workshops** have one or more Instructors or Helpers who have *received formal training from The Carpentries or an equivalent*.

### Bioinformatics Training Coordinator: Dr Chloé van der Burg, GA

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Chloé joins GA from the University of Otago, where she previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher exploring the genetic and behavioural mechanisms driving protogynous sex change in the New Zealand Spotty wrasse. Her research background broadly encompasses exploring evolutionary and functional genomics, with a focus on genomic drivers of fundamental and unusual physiological mechanisms in invertebrates, such as tephritid fruit flies and sea anemones. Chloé completed her PhD and undergraduate studies at the Queensland University of Technology (Brisbane, Australia), before moving to Dunedin, New Zealand in 2022. She brings a strong expertise in genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics and a passion for teaching to her role as training coordinator.
