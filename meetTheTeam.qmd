## Who are we?

The training team includes members of both Genomics Aotearoa and REANNZ (Research and Education Advanced Network New Zealand), as well as Postdoctoral Fellows and early career researchers who volunteer their time. 

All workshops are led by an **Instructor**: *subject matter experts who deliver high-level knowledge of the topic, demonstrating code in real-time*.

All workshops are supported by **Helpers**: *knowledgeable people who answer one-off questions or help you to solve issues as they arise*.  

**All workshops** have one or more Instructors or Helpers who have *received formal training from The Carpentries or an equivalent*.
