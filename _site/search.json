One or more instructors, our subject matter experts who have received formal teaching training, will demonstrate by writing code in real-time (‘live-coding’) while attendees follow along. Instructors provide details about what they are doing and explain the decision making and thought processes that they are going through. Attendees will follow the example of the instructors and then complete tasks independently or in small groups. All workshops will also have one or more Helpers: experienced members of the training community or subject matter experts who are on hand to answer questions and solve issues as they arise. Helpers ensure that no attendee is left behind and that everyone is able to complete tasks in a timely manner.\nOur workshops run with the help of New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI). This means there is no need to install software, no compatibility issues, no minimum computing requirements. Before the workshop you will create an account and all you will need to complete the workshop is a computer with an internet connection and a web browser.\nAll workshop material, which includes written notes that cover all main points, code examples, and tasks (as well as their solutions), is provided in advance and is freely available.\nWorkshops are either in person or online (zoom), and are usually one or two days (10am - 4pm)."

This includes:\n\nAn overview of the Shell, UNIX and Linux.\nDownloading data from a remote source and checking data integrity.\nRecap navigating files and directories, and commands used in routine tasks.\nInspecting and manipulating data, part 1 (the head, less, grep, and sed commands).\nInspecting and manipulating data, part 2 (using awk and bioawk to process text).\nAutomating file processing.\nChallenges: solve example molecular biology problems using shell scripts.\n\n\n\nIntermediate R: advance your skills with the R programming language\nAdvance your skills with R! You will learn to complete R tasks with fewer lines of code, scale your analyses, and write readable code. Some of the topics covered in the workshop are:\n\nIntroduction to relational data and the join function.\nWorking with regular expressions and functions from the stringr package.\nWriting custom functions, working with conditional statements.\n‘Defensive programming’.\nIterations - for loops, and map_*() functions.\nThe importance of data structure in R.\n\n\n\nOutlier Analysis\nIdentify regions of the genome that are under forms of selection during a two-day workshop. During this workshop you will:\n\nDownload example genomic data (or prepare your own).\nUse the PCAdapt tool to identify outlier loci within a genome.\nUse VCFtools to identify outlier SNPS in population comparisons.\nUse Bayescan to identify outlier SNPS based on allele frequencies.\nRelate identified SNPS to phenotypic variation.\nCompare the results of the different methods and discuss the results.\n\nThe focus of this workshop is on identifying signals of selection in an example genome using the outlier analysis method. Outlier analysis assumes that the majority of the genome is under neutral selection and some loci will appear as outliers relative to this background.\nThis lesson assumes learner has no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop. However, learners are expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts, including the concept of selection. You are expected to have some familiarity with both the R programming language and with basic command line (bash).\n\n\nIntroduction to Bash Scripting and HPC job scheduler\nGet started with writing your own scripts for data analysis and working on an HPC (high performance computing) environment. Some of the topics covered in the workshop are:\n\nDesigning a variant calling workflow.\nAutomating a workflow.\nAn introduction to HPC.\nWorking with job scheduler.\n\n\n\nConstructing Pangenome Graphs with PGGB\nHow to construct a pangenome graph using a popular tool (PGGB), including QC, variant extraction and short-read mapping. This workshop will include:\n\nAn introduction to pangenome graphs.\nSetup guide for using the tools and data in the workshop.\nOverview of the PGGB toolkit.\nChoosing parameters to construct a graph.\nQC\nExtracting variant data.\nMapping short reads against a pangenome graph.\n\n\n\nRNA-seq Data Analysis\nGet started with analysing RNA-seq datasets, identifying differentially expressed genes and highlighting impacted biological processes. Some of the topics covered in the workshop are:\n\nQuality assessment\nTrimming and filtering\nMapping and read counts\nDifferential expression analysis\nOver-representation analysis"

Each of these workshops can be done as a standalone crash course in a particular topic, and they can also be strung together to provide a strong foundation in bioinformatics principals and practices.\n\nIntroduction to Bash Scripting and HPC Job Scheduler\nGet started with writing your own scripts for data analysis and working on an HPC (high performance computing) environment. Some of the topics covered in the workshop are:\n\nDesigning a variant calling workflow.\nAutomating a workflow.\nAn introduction to HPC.\nWorking with job scheduler.\n\n\n\nIntroduction to the R programming language\nGet started with R, a highly popular programming language in the fields of biology and statistics. R is world-renowned for producing high-quality, publication-ready figures and tables. Note that this workshop is a pre-requisite for the RNA-seq Data Analysis workshop. Some of the topics covered in the workshop are:\n\nAn introduction to R and RStudio.\nR basics: The R language, reading data into R, storing data as objects.\nR packages.\nPublication-quality data presentation using ggplot2.\nKnitr: keep track of workflow and produce easy-to-follow reports of your work.\nWhere to get more help when you are ready to do more.\n\nWe assume the learner has no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop. However, learners are expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts.\n\n\nRNA-seq Data Analysis\nGet started with analysing RNA-seq datasets, identifying differentially expressed genes and highlighting impacted biological processes. Some of the topics covered in the workshop are:\n\nQuality assessment\nTrimming and filtering\nMapping and read counts\nDifferential expression analysis\nOver-representation analysis\n\n\n\nGenomics Data Carpentry (introduction to Shell)\nLearn the fundamentals of working with genomics data, data management and analysis in this two day workshop. This workshop will cover three topics:\n\nProject organisation\n\nData tidiness, project planning, examining data.\n\nIntroduction to the command line\n\nIntroducing the Shell, navigating files and directories, working with files and directories, redirection, scripts.\n\nData wrangling\n\nUsing RNA-seq data as an example: metadata, assessing data quality, example workflow."
