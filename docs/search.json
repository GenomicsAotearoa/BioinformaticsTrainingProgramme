During this workshop you will:\n\nDownload example genomic data (or prepare your own).\nUse the PCAdapt tool to identify outlier loci within a genome.\nUse VCFtools to identify outlier SNPS in population comparisons.\nUse Bayescan to identify outlier SNPS based on allele frequencies.\nRelate identified SNPS to phenotypic variation.\nCompare the results of the different methods and discuss the results.\n\nThe focus of this workshop is on identifying signals of selection in an example genome using the outlier analysis method. Outlier analysis assumes that the majority of the genome is under neutral selection and some loci will appear as outliers relative to this background.\nThis lesson assumes learner has no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop. However, learners are expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts, including the concept of selection. You are expected to have some familiarity with both the R programming language and with basic command line (bash).\nView the full workshop material here: Outlier Analysis"
