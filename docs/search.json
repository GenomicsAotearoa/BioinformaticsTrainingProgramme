One or more Instructors (subject matter experts who have received formal teaching training) will demonstrate by writing code in real-time while attendees follow along. Instructors provide details about what they are doing and explain the decision making and thought processes that they are going through. Attendees will follow along and work through all code at the same time as the Instructor. Short exercises, either for individuals or groups, will reinforce your learning. All workshops will also have one or more Helpers: experienced members of the training community or subject matter experts who are on hand to answer questions and solve issues as they arise. Helpers ensure that no attendee is left behind and that everyone is able to complete tasks in a timely manner.\nOur workshops run with the help of New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI). Our partnership with NeSI ensures there is no need to install software, no compatibility issues, no minimum computing requirements. All you will need to complete the workshop is a computer with an internet connection and a web browser.\nAll workshop material, which includes written notes that cover all main points, code examples, and tasks (as well as their solutions), is provided in advance and is freely available.\nWorkshops are either in person or online (zoom), and are usually one or two days (10am - 4pm)."

This includes:\n\nAn overview of the Shell, UNIX and Linux.\nDownloading data from a remote source and checking data integrity.\nRecap navigating files and directories, and commands used in routine tasks.\nInspecting and manipulating data, part 1 (the head, less, grep, and sed commands).\nInspecting and manipulating data, part 2 (using awk and bioawk to process text).\nAutomating file processing.\nChallenges: solve example molecular biology problems using shell scripts.\n\nView the full workshop material here: Intermediate Shell for Bioinformatics\n\n\nIntermediate R: advance your skills with the R programming language\nAdvance your skills with R! You will learn to complete R tasks with fewer lines of code, scale your analyses, and write readable code. Some of the topics covered in the workshop are:\n\nIntroduction to relational data and the join function.\nWorking with regular expressions and functions from the stringr package.\nWriting custom functions, working with conditional statements.\n‘Defensive programming’.\nIterations - for loops, and map_*() functions.\nThe importance of data structure in R.\n\nView the full workshop material here: Intermediate R: advancing your skills with the R programming language\n\n\nOutlier Analysis\nIdentify regions of the genome that are under forms of selection during a two-day workshop. During this workshop you will:\n\nDownload example genomic data (or prepare your own).\nUse the PCAdapt tool to identify outlier loci within a genome.\nUse VCFtools to identify outlier SNPS in population comparisons.\nUse Bayescan to identify outlier SNPS based on allele frequencies.\nRelate identified SNPS to phenotypic variation.\nCompare the results of the different methods and discuss the results.\n\nThe focus of this workshop is on identifying signals of selection in an example genome using the outlier analysis method. Outlier analysis assumes that the majority of the genome is under neutral selection and some loci will appear as outliers relative to this background.\nThis lesson assumes learner has no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop. However, learners are expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts, including the concept of selection. You are expected to have some familiarity with both the R programming language and with basic command line (bash).\nView the full workshop material here: Outlier Analysis"

This includes some basic exploratory analysis, some minor data transformation, and then thinking about the visual story. Finally, a fully realised visualisation will be created.\nThis workshop is split into four parts:\n\nBasic ggplot format and showcase of what can be done.\nSome data transformations and tidying, viz for exploratory analysis.\nGroup walkthrough of creating a visualization of example data.\nWorking on your own data: plan, transform data, visualize.\n\nPrerequisites: Comfortable using R / R Studio at a beginner level (have completed Introduction to R or have equivalent experience). Some familiarity with ggplot2 will be useful but not required.\nView the full workshop material here: From Start to Finish: Visualizing Your Data"

    "text": "Ancilliary programme\n\nOutlier Analysis\nIdentify regions of the genome that are under forms of selection during a two-day workshop. During this workshop you will:\n\nDownload example genomic data (or prepare your own).\nUse the PCAdapt tool to identify outlier loci within a genome.\nUse VCFtools to identify outlier SNPS in population comparisons.\nUse Bayescan to identify outlier SNPS based on allele frequencies.\nRelate identified SNPS to phenotypic variation.\nCompare the results of the different methods and discuss the results.\n\nThe focus of this workshop is on identifying signals of selection in an example genome using the outlier analysis method. Outlier analysis assumes that the majority of the genome is under neutral selection and some loci will appear as outliers relative to this background.\nThis lesson assumes learner has no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop. However, learners are expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts, including the concept of selection. You are expected to have some familiarity with both the R programming language and with basic command line (bash).\nView the full workshop material here: Outlier Analysis\n\n\n\nReproducible Bioinformatics with Nextflow and nf-core\nReproducible research is of the utmost importance. Nextflow is workflow management software that enables the writing of scalable and reproducible scientific workflows. It can integrate various software packages and environment management systems from environment modules to Docker, Singularity, and Conda. It allows for existing pipelines written in common scripting languages to be seamlessly coupled together. Nextflow simplifies the implementation and execution of workflows on cloud or high-performance computing infrastructures.\nIn this workshop you will:\n\nBe introduced to Nextflow and execute an example pipeline.\nBe introduced to nf-core, an online repository of curated pipelines.\nLearn how to configure and customise an existing nf-core pipeline.\nGenerate metrics and reports.\n\nView the full workshop material here: Reproducible Bioinformatics Workflows with Nextflow and nf-core\n\n\n\nConstructing Pangenome Graphs with PGGB\nHow to construct a pangenome graph using a popular tool (PGGB), including QC, variant extraction and short-read mapping. This workshop will include:\n\nAn introduction to pangenome graphs.\nSetup guide for using the tools and data in the workshop.\nOverview of the PGGB toolkit.\nChoosing parameters to construct a graph.\nQC\nExtracting variant data.\nMapping short reads against a pangenome graph.\n\nView the full workshop material here: Unlock the Power of Pangenome Graphs\n\n\n\nScaling Gene Regulatory Networks Simulations\nSimulate gene regulatory networks using R and Julia.\nThis workshop will include:\n- Why simulations are valuable in systems biology,\n- What regulatory networks are and how they can be modelled,\n- How to use the sismonr R package to simulate a small regulatory network, and\n- Introduction to High performance computing (HPC)\n- HPC architectures\n- Batch systems and using a Slurm scheduler\n- HPC architectures\n- How to scale up simulations on a HPC through profiling and optimisation\nView the full workshop material here: Scaling Gene Regulatory Networks Simulations"
