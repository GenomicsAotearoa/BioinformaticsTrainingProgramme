Workshop material covers basic coding for beginners to highly advanced, specialised workflows.\nWe work closely with our partners at REANNZ (Research and Education Advanced Network New Zealand), who have custom built a digital training platform to host workshops. When you join a training session, either in person or over zoom, you will access a digital environment with everything you need. No installations, no software requirements, all you need is an internet connection.\nSince it’s inception in 2019, Genomics Aotearoa’s training programme has hosted more than 120 workshops reaching more than 2,000 participants."

    "text": "Workshop structure, style and expectation\nOur training workshops are interactive live-coding events. One or more instructors (subject matter experts who have received formal teaching training) will demonstrate by writing code in real-time while attendees follow along. Instructors provide details about what they are doing and explain the decision making and thought processes that they are going through. Attendees will follow along and work through all code at the same time as the Instructor. Short exercises, either for individuals or groups, will reinforce your learning. All workshops will also have one or more Helpers: experienced members of the training community or subject matter experts who are on hand to answer questions and solve issues as they arise. Helpers ensure that no attendee is left behind and that everyone is able to complete tasks in a timely manner.\nOur workshops run with the help of REANNZ, using the Open OnDemand web portal. Our partnership with REANNZ ensures there is no need to install software, no compatibility issues, no minimum computing requirements. All you will need to complete the workshop is a computer with an internet connection and a web browser.\nAll workshop material, which includes written notes that cover all main points, code examples, and tasks (as well as their solutions), is provided in advance and is freely available - visit our Workshop Portfolio page.\nWorkshops are either in person or online (zoom), and are typically run across one day (10am - 4pm) or two days (9am - 1pm). Our core program workshops are run multiple times through the year. Our ancillary program is run based on demand or expression of interest.\nAll workshops are run under The Carpentries Code of Conduct to promote a safe and inclusive working environment."

Projects are organised under the three themes of Health, Environment, and Primary Production and are underpinned by a focus on bioinformatics and Te Ao Māori. Government-funded through the Strategic Science Investment Fund, Genomics Aotearoa aims to grow and develop our country’s research capabilities while carrying out cutting edge research. Genomics Aotearoa endeavours to be an inclusive environment, and strives to put Te Ao Māori (the Māori worldview) at the core of our research and training. The training programme is a core part of GA’s commitment to building capability and capacity in the fields of bioinformatics and genomics for New Zealand researchers.\nYou can learn more about Genomics Aotearoa, including details about the research Projects and highlights of our recent work stories, on our main page."
