### Introduction to Shell {.workshop-header}

<img src="assets/workshop-mainpage-image/introtoshell.png" alt="Welcome to Shell" class="workshop-image">

Learn the fundamentals of working with the Command Line Interface (CLI). Shell is a program that allows you to interact with the command line. Familiarity with the shell will allow you to access remote servers, automate tasks, and use a wide range of tools that are unavailable on a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

During this workshop you will learn:

- The importance of the shell.
- How to navigate files and directories.
- How to create, view and modify files.
- Pipes, redirection, and scripts, which will allow you to automate your workflow.

**Prerequisites:** We assume the learner has no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop. However, learners are expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts.

**Format:** Taught over one day (10am - 4pm).
